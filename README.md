# Practice Repository for Python

Welcome to the Python Practice Repository. This repository is structured to help you reinforce your skills in Python through a variety of exercises, mini-exercises, and katas. Each section is designed to progressively enhance your understanding of core concepts, improve your problem-solving skills, and build a strong foundation in Python.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized into three main folders, each serving a unique purpose:

Exercises:

This folder contains comprehensive exercises that cover a wide range of topics. Each exercise is designed to deepen your understanding of fundamental concepts, such as syntax, data structures, and control flow, in Python.
Mini Exercises:

Mini exercises are shorter tasks aimed at specific skills or concepts. These quick exercises are ideal for targeted practice and are perfect for refreshing specific topics or for daily coding warm-ups.
Katas:

The Katas folder contains coding challenges inspired by real-world problems and classic programming katas. These tasks range in difficulty and are intended to help you develop efficient problem-solving techniques, as well as proficiency in using Python for algorithmic challenges.
